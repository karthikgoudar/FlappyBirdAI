# Flappy Bird AI

This is a classic version of the popular game Flappy Bird, created using Python and Pygame. It features a pixel-perfect collision system using masks and an AI that improves with each generation using the NEAT module.

## Gameplay
The gameplay of Flappy Bird involves navigating a bird through pipes by tapping the screen to make the bird flap its wings and fly upwards. The game ends when the bird collides with a pipe or falls to the ground.

## Features
- Pixel-perfect collision system using masks: This ensures that the bird and pipes collide with each other only when they touch each other's visible pixels, making the gameplay more realistic.
- AI using the NEAT module: This allows the game to evolve over time, with each generation of birds improving on the previous generation's performance.

## Technology Stack
This game is made using the following technologies:
- Python: to create the game logic and AI.
- Pygame: to create the graphics and handle user input.
- NEAT module: to implement the AI.

## Setup
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install Pygame and NEAT module using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the game using `python flappy_bird.py`.
4. Use the spacebar to make the bird flap its wings and fly upwards.
